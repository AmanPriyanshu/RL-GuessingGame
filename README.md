# RL-GuessingGame
Can models adjust to truths and deception or can they replicate herd mentality. Best strategy simulation for Guessing Game. Where player can pick a single chit from a bucket of chits, which contain two types of chits, say Red and Blue, now those players that choose the correct chit get reward.

## Qualitative Analysis over Experiments
The RLAgent is successfully distinguish that majority sampling is to be done only when a sufficient number of passes is over. And rather it is prone to saying its own chit if it is among the first few sampling members.

We can show this with the demo_image.
